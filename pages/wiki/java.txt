====== Principles ======
===== SOLID (object-oriented design) =====
  * **S:** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle]] the **single responsibility principle** states that every class should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. 
  * [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle]]**Open/closed principle:** "the open/closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification""
  * **Liskov substitution principle**
  *** Interface segregation principle**
  * **Dependency inversion principle :**  the dependency inversion principle refers to a specific form of decoupling software modules. 

===== CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) =====

====== Java patterns ======

====== Concurency ======
  * The __ConcurrentHashMap__ performs better than the HashMap in nearly all situations
  * __Deadlock:__ 2 or more threads waiting for each other to finish
  * __Livelock:__ threads in lockstep, each trying to do work but finding another "in the way"
