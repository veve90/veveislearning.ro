====== Computer network ======
===== Definitions =====

**PV** = **Paravirtualization** = "is a virtualization technique that presents a software interface to virtual machines that is similar, but not identical to that of the underlying hardware."

**HVM** = **Hardware-assisted virtualization ** = **native virtualization** = " hardware-assisted virtualization is a platform virtualization approach that enables efficient full virtualization using help from hardware capabilities, primarily from the host processors."

**NAS** = **Network Attached Storage** = a server that has a light OS, connected to a network, that supports the popular file sharing protocols. It is usually used for saving shared data between different clients. At home, it is used for saving backups.

**SAN** = **Storage Area Network** = is a high speed network that connect multiple storage devices to multiple servers

**Blade Server** 
  * is a server that contains multiple modules (blades) in the same chassis (optimized for saving space). 
  * it is often used in data centers
  * it can be self-standing or rack mounted. 
  * the chassis __provides the power supply__, and __each blade has its own CPU, memory and hard disk__.
  * ususlly they provide their own management systems and may include a network or storage switch

**HPC** = ** High Performance Computing** = Usually refers to using multiple computers in order to have the needed power. (cluster of computers)



**OSI Model** =  **Open Systems Interconnection model** = "is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard of their underlying internal structure and technology" (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)

The original version of the model defined seven layers.

**1-GbE Ethernet Standard** = **Gigabit Ethernet** = is used for various technologies that can transmit data at 1 Gigabit per second, as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard


**ECMP** =** Equal-cost multi-path routing** = is a stategy of packet forwarding, that finds multiple "best paths" , and that uses a "per-hop decision" in order to find the best paths.

**Spanning-Tree Protocol**= a protocol that is takes care that there is no loop in the topology. It is used in local Ethernet networks.


=====  Network Architecture =====
**oversubscribe** = the desired bandwidth devided by the available bandwidth


====3 Tiers ====
  * lot of North/South communication
{{ :wiki:three_tier.png |}}
====Spine fabric ====
  * East/west communication
  * Mostly used in virtualized infrastructures

=====  Virtualization =====
source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization

"**Paravirtualization** is a technique in which the hypervisor provides an API and the OS of the guest virtual machine calls that API, requiring OS modifications."

**Full virtualization(HVM)**  relies on binary translation to trap and virtualize the execution of certain sensitive, non-virtualizable instructions. 
Note: VirtualBox is an implementation of full virtualization.

===== Chef/Puppet  =====
https://www.chef.io/chef/

https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet

Chef and puppet have the same goals :automate the build of your infrastructure. " transform your infrastructure into code"

**How does it work?**
  * The server (chef/Puppet) stores your recipes as well as other configuration data. 
  * The Chef/Puppet client is installed on each server.
  * The client periodically polls Chef/Puppet server recipe configuration (policy) and if one of the server is out of date, the client brings it up to date.
