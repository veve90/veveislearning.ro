Chef and puppet have the same goals :automate the build of your infrastructure. " transform your infrastructure into code"

**How does it work?**
  * The server (chef/Puppet) stores your recipes as well as other configuration data. 
  * The Chef/Puppet client is installed on each server.
  * The client periodically polls Chef/Puppet server recipe configuration (policy) and if one of the server is out of date, the client brings it up to date.
