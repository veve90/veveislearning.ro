====== Pig is using too much disk while map-reduce ======
===== Use Diferent Names =====
Use diferent names for each single variable (do not reuse variables names). Pig will not know if he can or cannot delete some temporary data.
  
===== Check the projections after group by===== 
Something like:
<code>
data_grouped = GROUP A BY (b, c,d);
data_projected = FOREACH data_grouped  {
    GENERATE 
	group.b as b,
	group.c as c,
	group.d as d,
        A.e as e;
};
</code>

will be much more disk consuming than:

<code>
data_grouped = GROUP A BY (b, c,d);

data_projected = FOREACH data_grouped  {
    GENERATE 
			FLATTEN (group) as (b,c,d),
			A.e as e;
};
</code>
