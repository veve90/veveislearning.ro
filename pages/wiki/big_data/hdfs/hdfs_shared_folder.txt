 Example done by using cloudera quickstart.
**Prerequisites:** test users (I'm having test1,test2, and cloudera user that are taking part of the developer group)

  * Open a terminal
  * Sign into hdfs user and create the folder:
  <code>
  su hdfs
  hadoop fs -mkdir /folderName
  </code>
  * change the ownership of the folder
  <code>
  hadoop fs -chown -R cloudera:developer /folderName
  hadoop fs -chgrp -R developer /folderName
  </code>
  * sign in into the test1 user and create a folder
  * sign in into the test2 user and acces the folder created by test1 and create a new folder insight
  * sign in with a user that is not tking part of the developer group
  
  
Thant was all!
