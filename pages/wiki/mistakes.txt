====== Mistakes ======


In life we are doing a lot of mistakes. I personally do a lot of mistakes (not only writing mistakes but others too). 

I think that when we are doing a mistake, and somebody forgives us, we are more inclined to forgive others and be better persons.

However, when we are doing a mistake and we are not having the courage to admit it... it becomes a burden.
And that is hard. I am caring some burdens ... and that is not a good thing. I'm trying to escape from them. But it is not easy. 

Also, when somebody made a mistake in my behalf...and he didn't realized it, or didn't admit it I am inclined to try to ignore the mistake, but I do not always manage to ignore it...
I think I did a lot of mistakes, but I do not have the courage to admit them all yet...
