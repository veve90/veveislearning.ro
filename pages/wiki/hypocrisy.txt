====== hypocrisy  and/or judgment======

**I am hypocrite; just as any other person.** I think I would like to write everything that I believe about this subject, but I'm afraid. Afraid of whom?  Of what?

of every **judgment** that may happen. My judgment...your judgment! I admit, mostly mine judgment, because I may never know yours.(hopefully)
