====== Caring (couples situation) ======

''"caring = displaying kindness and concern for others"''

''"caring = the work or practice of looking after those unable to care for themselves, especially on account of age or illness."
''

===== Not absolute =====

Caring, for me is all these definitions plus the fact that the carring act is not absolute. You can care about a person today, and don't care about him tomorow.

We will take as example all your ex-boyfriends/ex-girlfriends. Do you still care about them? Do you still display concern about them?

However, the stop of the carring act happens when something happend. That something is often a separation and the separation often happens because of something too. It may be ceating, it may  be something else. That something else is often:
 
  * - they got married, 
  * - you think you know the the other person completely, 
  * - you are a careen person, 
  * - you live in the same house with your boyfriend and his/your parents
  * - you live in the same house with you boyfriend and his/your friends/ cousins...

===== Why? =====

Because these  situations are a source of the **4 horsemen of Gottman** .
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_sexual_monogamy 

==== Criticism ====

I will take the case of ''" you live in the same house with you boyfriend and his/your friends/ cousins"'' because it's my case.

I'm with my boyfriend since 5 years. He forgot about me and my needs the moment we got his cousin and her boyfriend to live in our house for free. 

Since then is only
  * ''  'veve, why you are always doing this' ''
  * '' 'veve, did you say something to them (as you always do)?'''
  * '''veve don't do this!'''
  *'' 'veve why did you did that?'''
  * '''veve ...'''

When I get angry, and try to say to him that I need some attention too, It becomes
'''veve, you are always angry at me'''

When I say 'It all started when your cousin camed' he says'' 'No, you always been like this, you always wanted to split up'''

I'm in the fucking center of the negative  thoughts :)) So, the first horsemen of the 'Gottman' separation is here:

''"Criticism — instead of complaining about a behavior, you attack your partner's personality or character, usually with blame. Criticism of personality also comes in the form of listing complaints about past behaviors and thereby suggesting a character fault."''

However, I beleive this first horsemen, can be , in my case stopped with a proactive behaviour.
Since I'm not the most intelligent human being I'm not proactive. It's very hard to be proactive. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactivity  but it's fucking useful!

I tried, but I realy can't. It's just like stop eating chocolate when I'm angry. It's a fucking sport mind.


==== Defensiveness ====
One of the horsemens of a relanshionship.

''"Defensiveness — defensiveness is a way of avoiding taking responsibility for setting things right by denying responsibility, making excuses, attributing negative thoughts to partners, using one's own complaints to counter a partner's complaints, and simply repeating oneself"''

Just before I spoke about the fact that if I would be proactive I would probably save my relationship. And this is why. 

When you got criticised, you have the tendancy to criticise as well. When you are saying that ' I need more attention' and your boyfriend is saying 'You are all always angry on me' and then you are saying again your need, and then he is saying his need, and this is happening again and again.. the horsemen is validated (checked) 

However, if you are proactive (or at least one of the persons in the coupe is), you are not going in a circle. You are not criticising just because you just got criticised. You are tring to find solutions. You are tring to fullfill the need of your partner. And fullfill your's as well, but not by bringing a criticism on the table.

==== Stonewalling ====
Stonewalling is just another horsemen in the breakdown.

''" Stonewalling — stonewalling is a breakdown of communication. The partners turn into 'stone walls' and stop responding to communication. "''

Since we are living in the same house with her cousin, which doens't have to find out that is her fault that we argue we are not arguing. And all this because she is tryng to find a job (since 6 months), so she is not very ok. 

Since she doesn't have to find out, because she is not ok, and my boyfriend will feel very down if she leaves before she found her job, we are just avoiding ourselfs. Because "we" care so much about her, that "we" forgot to care about us. 


==== Contempt ====
 
''"Contempt — contempt is criticism that is intended to insult and psychologically abuse a partner. Contempt reflects a very negative view of your partner. It entails a lack of concern for the partner. Whereas anger is an attempt to fix a problem or convince a person to change, contempt is a total dismissal of any hope that the problem can be fixed."''

Caring also depends on each person's values. For some persons, caring means to give something to eat to por person. To others, it means to care when the other person is ill. 

However, the fact that each person has different values, means that in a couple, if you don't share the same caring values, you may have your  expectencies fail. You may think that you already showed care towards your partner, but she didn't notice it, because she doesn't have the same values.

That also means that if you fell that you are angry on your boyfriend, and that you are saying something ( a criticism) you may percive it just as a criticism and the other person may percive it as a contempt.

 And so, the last horsemen is checked and the relationshipt is just on the edge of the separation.

===== Other factors that could help your relationship =====
On wikipedia  I could find some  other  factors that could help my relationship:

  * Separating from the family of origin (parents, brothers, sisters, etc.) => KO and I don't want this to happen
  * Building togetherness and creating autonomy => OK, I just finish university, I'm autonom, and he is also
  * Becoming parents => KO and I don't want to become one (yet)
  * Coping with crisis => KO, every time  we switched appartements (twice) we had big argues
  * Making a safe place for conflict => KO, we have his cusin at our place
  * Exploring sexual love and intimacy => KO, we have his cousin at our place
  * Sharing laughter and keeping interests alive => not sure
  * Providing emotional nurturance => not sure
  * Preserving a double vision => ?

  * Ability to change and adapt to change => OK, we both changed  countries and addaped
  * Ability to live with the unchangeable => ?
  * Assumption of permanence (i.e., the marriage will last a lifetime) => ?
  * Trust => OK
  * Balance of dependencies (power) => OK
  * Enjoyment of each other's company => OK
