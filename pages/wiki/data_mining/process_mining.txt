===== Conduct a process mining project=====

  * stage 0: plan and justify
      * types of projects
            * data-driven
            * question driven
            * goal driven
      * plan project
      * justify planned activities
  * stage 1: extract and transform event data
  * stage 2: create the control flow model and connect it to th event log (create a suitable control flow model)
  * stage 3: create an overall model: data mining technics in order to integrate other attributes
  * stage 4: operational support: recomendations, detection... (only reachable for lasagna processes)


----
===== Usefull ====
  * when we have processes with bottlenecks
  * when we have data with a time notion
  * when we want to predict
  * ...


===== Vocabulary =====


  ***play in:** create the model from the traces(examples)
  ***play out:** from a model get the traces
  ***replay:** play the given traces on the model in order to see if there are any deviations
  ***process discovery:** 
  ***enhancement**
      * guards: define one type of path in a graph
      *types: 
             *extension: adding aditional perspective to the model using event data
             *repair:
  ***lasagna processes != spaghetti processes**
             * lasagna process 
                   * => structured, regular
                   * => fitness at least of 0.8
                   * => all techniques learn can be applied
                         * => analyse root causes for deviations
                         * => compare process mining
                         * => operational support
             * spaghetti process 
                   * => ETL is more complex than in the lasagna processes
                   * => try to make it simpler
                           * focus on a subset of activities
                           * focus on a subset of cases
                           * make clusters
                           * focus only on the most frequent activities
                   * => Highlight important problems

===== Process Mining Property =====
{{ :wiki:data_mining:model_property.png?nolink&300 |}}


====Bias in Process Mining====
  * Alpha algorithm doesn't know to do OR-Joins
  * K concurent activities: K! traces
  * K optional activities sum(combinaison(k,i)*k!)
  * Concurency can be discovered by the Alpha algorithm
  * visualisation of discovered model is different than the representaiton of the bias
  * most miners are using petri net or other representation for creating the model. Usually the BPMN is offered only afterwords (after a conversion)

=====Representations=====
There are different representations that can /are used by process mining algorithms:

  * [[wiki:data_mining:process_mining:wf|Workflow Nets (WF)]]

=====Algorithms - process discovery=====

  * [[wiki:data_mining:process_mining:alpha_algorithm|Alpha Algorithm]]
  * [[wiki:data_mining:process_mining:2_phase|2 Phase Process discovery]]


**
Other algorithms:**


  * inductive miner
  * fuzzy miner
  * [ProM has 600 plug in]
  * [[wiki:data_mining:process_mining:alternatives|Other Alternatives]]



----

=====Conformance checking=====
  * - the replay fitness is the most important property that is cheched.
  * - evaluate the process discovery process
  * - conformance to specification
  * - auditing

**Notes:**
  * Parento front for considering 2 dimensions (fitness & precision or precision & simplicity)
  * Positives & negative deviations (is the process wrong or is the log wrong?)

===== Process Mining link to Data Mining =====

The data mining techniques can classify our data in female/male etc. and help us know why a certain token did a certain movement in a or-split/and-split etc.

  * **predictor variables =** all data that we have about our activities
  * **predicted/response variable =** activities

**note:** the more variables we have the more combinations we have and the more sparse will be our data

===== Choose the right data to analyse =====


  * finding and selectig the data. when we have an UML diagram of our data, when choosing what to anayse, answer the questions:
            * what is the process model about?
            * what are the activities?
  * flatten event data => what are the instances?
  * Data quality problems
            * missing data
            * incorrect data
            * imprecise data
            * irrelevant data

**Examples**
  * Examples of data quality problems
            * timestamps of events are missing
            * in reallity there are cases that are executed but not recorded in the log
            * resources that executed an activity have not been recorded
            * event attribute was not recorded
            * 
**Guidelines for logging**
  * __terminology__
          * reference = has a reference name and an identifier that refers to some object
          * attribute = have a name and a value
  * the reference names should have the same meaning for all peoples
  * there should be a structured and managed collection of refence and attributes names
  * references should be stable (should not be contect depended)
  * attributes names should be as precise as possible
  * uncertanty with the respect of occurence
  * events should be partially ordered
  * if possible store transactional information about the event (start, complete, abort,...)
  * perform regular checks of the logging
  * ensure comparability of event logs over time
  * do not aggregate events in the event log
  * do not remove events that have happened: do not remove students that failed...
  * ensure privacy without loosing meaningful correlations
