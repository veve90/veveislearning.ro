  * use the computation of the best case scenario 
  * **cost function =** compute move in model only+ compute move in trace only
  * **fitness =** use the worst case scenario = 1 - (optimal cost function)/ (trace length + best case scenario length)

  * + => can help us find out where the deviants happen
  * + => can help us to drill down
