  * - if one "a" is entering/all "a" are entering
  * - if one "a" is exiting/all "a" are exiting
  * - if one "a" is inside/all "a" are Inside
  * - if one "a" is outside/all "a" are outside
  * - if the starting point is in a region, we are adding a token in that place 

**Trivial regions**
  * the empty region
  * the region consisting of all states

**Any combination of 2 regions are also a region.**
