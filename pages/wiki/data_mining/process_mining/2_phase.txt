  * **Step 1:** learn the transition system (see creating a transition system)
  * **Step 2:** build a petri net from the transition system by using regions

The transition system and the petri net are **bisimilar**. (any movement in the petri net /transition system can be mimic by the transition system/petri net)

**Limitations:**
  * inability to discover particular process constructs

For transition systems with 0 non-trivial regions, the petri net has one transition and no placess and it allows more transitions => apply a "forword closure" property

**Note:** PromM is allready ensures the bisimilar property

  * inability to balance the 4 forcess (fitness and simplicity /generalisation and precision)

=> no special consideration for generalization/simplicity in the discovery phase 


**Conclusions**

  * this method is better than the alpha algorithm because it can discover complex process patterns
  * this method provides insight into the essence of process discovery
  * this method has overfitting problems
  * this method is inable to leave out infrequent behaviour
  * this method ha noise and incompletness problems
