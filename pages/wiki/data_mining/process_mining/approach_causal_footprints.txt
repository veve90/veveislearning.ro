==== Causal footprints ====
  * - matrice that is showing the link between all element sin a trace
  * - the element is showing if a is folowing by b etc...


{{ :wiki:data_mining:footprint.png?nolink&300 |}}

  * footprint-conformance = 1 => perfect match
  * footprint-conformance = 0 => worst match
  * the footprint matrice can be computed by starting from the logs or from the model => the differences can be analyzed and diagnosed => the conformance checking can be done by computing the propability of the differences

**limitations:**
  * frequences are not used
  * behaviour is only considered indirectly
  * aims to capture fitness/precision and generalization in a single metric
