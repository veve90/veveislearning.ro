===== Workflow Nets (WF-Nets) and BPM =====


  * BPM (Business Process Management) = liking between IT and process management
  * BPMN = Business process model and notation
  * EPCs = Event driven process chains
  * WF-Nets = a type of Petry Nets with one start place and one end state.
  * Is my model a good model?

  *  no if it contains deadlocks
  *  no if there is and AND-split without an AND-join associated
  *  no dead states
  *  if the end state is reached, all the other states should be empty 
**Soundness**
{{ :wiki:data_mining:soundness.png?nolink&300 |}}
  * places cannot hold multiple tokens at the same time
  * no dead parts
  * have the option to complete

**Propetries**

The option to complete implies proper completion
A WF-net is sound if and only if the corresponding "short-circuited" Petri net is live and bounded
