===== Transition systems =====
{{ :wiki:data_mining:transitionsystem.png?nolink&300 |}}

The reachability graph is a special kind of transition system 

**Vocabulary**

  * states: markings in petry net
  * transitions: transitions in petry net
  * final state: final marking in petry net
**Properties**

Complete traces go from the initial state to the final state.
The transition system may have a lot more states that places in the correspondant petry net.

===Building a transition system===

  * Prefix automaton(example)

We have to take into consideration
  * - a sequence/a set of events before/after each state
  * - the different types of building the model (tacking sets or sequences or futer vs past) will change the model
