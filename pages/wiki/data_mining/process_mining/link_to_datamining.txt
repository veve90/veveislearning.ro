===== Process Mining link to Data Mining =====

The data mining techniques can classify our data in female/male etc. and help us know why a certain token did a certain movement in a or-split/and-split etc.

  * **predictor variables =** all data that we have about our activities
  * **predicted/response variable =** activities

**note:** the more variables we have the more combinations we have and the more sparse will be our data

we can use guards or probabilistics in order to make the link between data mining and process mining:
  * guards: shows the different paths that can be taken in the process mining representation
  * probabilistrics: shows the probabilistics that a certain guard thake a certain path in the representation

**Guards:**
  * descriptive
  * prescriptive

**Note:** in Prom => search for the "data-aware" keyword
