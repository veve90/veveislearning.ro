===== Alpha Algorithm =====
{{ :wiki:data_mining:alpha.png?nolink&300 |}}

  * helps us transform the event logs into a petry net graph
  * the first algorithm beeing able to discover concurency
  * the alpha algorithm focuses only on the order of the activities
  * an event log is transformed to a multised of traces
  * a trace is a sequence of activity names

**How does the alpha algorithm works?**
{{ :wiki:data_mining:alpha1.png?nolink&300 |}}
**Vocabulary:**

  * direct succession: at least one case when we had a folowed by b in the event log
  * causality: b is folowed by a but a is never folowed by b
  * parallell: when we have a folowed by b and b folowed by a
  * choice: e is never folowed by b and b is never folowed by e

The alpha algorithm can be aplied with the ProM tool. PromM tutorials: http://www.promtools.org/doku.php?id=tutorial:start

The alpha algorithm contains only 8 scary steps.

**Notations:**

  * L= event log
  * T = transitions
  * t = one transition
**Steps:**

  * T(i) = the activities that happen at the first
  * T(o) = the activities that happen at the end
  * X(L) = find pairs of sets (A,B) where
  * in the A set no element of A is folowing any A element
  * in the B set no element of B is folowing any B element
  * all elements of A are folowing all elements of B.
  * Y(L) = X(L) with A and B maximal
  * P(l) = add initial and final places to all sets from Y(L)

**Limitations**

  * implicit places: places that are not adding value/ redundant places, solved through pre-processing
  * loops bbbb: when an activity is folowing itself, solved through preprocessing
  * loops couples cb: when we are having a loop of couples cb , solved through pre-processing
  * non local dependency: : cannot be solved
  * multiple transitions having the same label: allow transition without no label
  * OR-join: the resolution is made in the region-based miner algorithm
  * deadlock:
  * noise: traces that are infrequent, not specific to the alpha-algorithm, other models also have problems with it
  * incompleteness: the flower model example, not specific to the alpha-algorithm, other models also have problems with it
  * it cannot assume a notion of completness.
