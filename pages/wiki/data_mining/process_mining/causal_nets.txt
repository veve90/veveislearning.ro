====Causal Nets or C-Nets ====
{{ :wiki:data_mining:cnet.png?nolink |}}
  * start activity: **a** and can happen only once
  * after **a** we can have either **b** and **d** or **c** and **d** (see **bindings**)
  * notion of **obligation**: like tokens
  * at the end we shouldn't have any **obligation**
  * end activity : **z**
  * no more notion of deadblocks..
  * there are translations into petri net representaitons
  * used by algorithms that are less sensitives to noise
  * valid bindings sequences of C-net => valid firing sequence of WF-net
