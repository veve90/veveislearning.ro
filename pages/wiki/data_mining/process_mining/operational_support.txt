====== Operational Support : Detect, Predict, Recommend======
  * Detect if someting is going wrong right now
  * Recommand which activities should be executed
  * Predict when will the case finish
  * ...
**Operational support **
  * **detection:**  compare the normative model with the trace log. If it doesn't fit => detect fault.
  * **prediction:** compare the normative model with the trace log and predict completion of the trace.


**Use an anotated transition system:**
  * t = time entering state
  * e = elapsed time
  * r = remaining time
  * s = sojourn time

**Do this for a bunch of cases and compute variance, average time etc.**

**Note:** 
  * Use context while recommendetation ( do not ignore that there are a lot of cases waiting in a queue)
  * Ability to predict = ability to recommend
