====== Mining Social Networks ======
  * **graph representation**
       * arcs = relationships
       * centrality
               * degree centrality
               * closeness centrality
               * betweeness centrality
       *  while creating the graph the **control function** have to be taken into consideration
       * can be analysed in many ways. 


  * **resource activity matrix** (resource X activity)
       * shows who is doing what 
       * the columns 
               * the sum is equal to number of cases is the log where the resource did the activity divided by (number of total cases divided by number of activities)
               * the value is equal to the percentage of the sum where the resource did the activity


**Prom can handle this kind of representations**
  * there are different algorithms for different distance notions
  * sometimes we can replace activity names by resources names
