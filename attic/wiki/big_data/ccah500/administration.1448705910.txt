====== 4. Hadoop Cluster Installation and Administration (25%) ======

===== Given a scenario, identify how the cluster will handle disk and machine failures =====
  * HDFS replicates data blocks on nodes on different racks

**If a NodeManager fails: ** 
    * the Resource Manager removes it from the list of the active nodes
    * the tasks on this node are considered as failed by the ApplicationManager
    * if the ApplicationManager fails => failed application


**If the ResourceManager fails: ** 
  * No application or task can be launched
  * can be configured in HA


**If NameNode goes down:**
  * if we are not in HA , the cluster is inaccessible

**If DataNode goes down:**
  * the NameNode will re-replicate the blocks that were on this machine
  * the jobs will access the data on the remaining machines
===== Analyze a logging configuration and logging configuration file format =====

=====   Understand the basics of Hadoop metrics and cluster health monitoring =====

===== Identify the function and purpose of available tools for cluster monitoring =====

===== Be able to install all the ecoystme components in CDH 5, including (but not limited to): Impala, Flume, Oozie, Hue, Cloudera Manager, Sqoop, Hive, and Pig =====

===== Identify the function and purpose of available tools for managing the Apache Hadoop file system =====
